# WPF Data Grid - Getting Started

This example is the application created in the [Getting Started](https://docs.devexpress.com/WPF/5863/controls-and-libraries/data-grid/getting-started) tutorial. It demonstrates the base functionality of the [WPF Data Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/WPF/6084/controls-and-libraries/data-grid).

This project is based on the following example: [https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/wpf-blank-app-with-the-northwind-database](https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/wpf-blank-app-with-the-northwind-database).

## More Examples

The following example shows how to bind the WPF Data Grid to different data sources: [Bind the WPF Data Grid to Data](https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/how-to-bind-wpf-grid-to-data).

This example includes multiple solutions that demonstrate:

* How to bind the Data Grid to Entity Framework, EF Core, and XPO.
* Different binding mechanisms: virtual sources, server mode sources, and local data.
* MVVM and code-behind patterns.

After you bind the Data Grid to a database, you can implement CRUD operations (create, read update, delete). View Example: [Implement CRUD Operations in the WPF Data Grid](https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/how-to-implement-crud-operations).
